# Green Lanterns Headquarters

Tickets support system. This project is a spin-off of BCU.

# Todo List

- As a User I want to open new tickets so I can be served
- As a salesperson I want to show what is happening with more frequency so the green lanterns can give more attention to that cases
- As a Green Lantern I want to reorder tickets so I can make visible to the rest of team what is the current priorities
- As a Green Lantern I want to mark a ticket as doing/done so the team can see what is happening
